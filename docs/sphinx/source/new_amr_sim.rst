Adding grid adaptivity
======================

In this tutorial, we will add AMR capabilities to the DJL solitary wave simulation that we developed in :doc:`Creating single-level simulations<new_sim>`. It is strongly encouraged that you follow along with that tutorial before proceeding to this one.

.. By the nature of AMR, there are a confusing number of parameters to
.. tweak. Many of these control how the workload is balanced among the processors.
.. In this section, we will discuss how to choose your simulation's setup to gain
.. maximum efficiency.
